 * Add test/live keys
 * Set payment mode (test/live)

 ## How to
 
 1. Capture
 * In Instant mode, the orders are captured automatically
 * In delayed mode you can capture an order by moving the order to the completed status. 
 2. Refund
   * To refund an order you can use the refund action in woocommerce, type the amount and use the refund via paylike button.
 3. Void
   * To void an order you can use the refund action in woocommerce, type the amount and use the refund via paylike button. You can only do this if the order is not captured, if you have captured already use the refund. 
   
## Updating the receipt payment template
   
For the payment page in the "Redirect to payment page after order created" Checkout mode, you can overwrite the template by creating a file in your theme under `paylike/receipt.php`.
Make sure to include an element with the id of `paylike-payment-button` so that the user is able to make the payment.


## Advanced

Due to the floating point precision issue with some numbers, it is recommended to have the bcmath extension installed.
