 * In Instant mode, the orders are captured automatically
 * In delayed mode you can capture an order by moving the order to the completed status. 
 2. Refund
   * To refund an order you can use the refund action in woocommerce, type the amount and use the refund via paylike button.
 3. Void

## Updating the receipt payment template
   
For the payment page in the "Redirect to payment page after order created" Checkout mode, you can overwrite the template by creating a file in your theme under `paylike/receipt.php`.
Make sure to include an element with the id of `paylike-payment-button` so that the user is able to make the payment.


## Advanced

Due to the floating point precision issue with some numbers, it is recommended to have the bcmath extension installed.
